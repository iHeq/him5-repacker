# him5-repacker
repacker for him5/him4/hxp dependant on fushigi

usage:
>*py repacker.py [folder with translated scripts/images/sounds]*

# Notes
The Him5 repacker doesn't serve a purpose and should be only used for developing tools that actually incorperate the HEX System used by the respective game.
The Him4 repacker can be used to repack archives that contain images. 

If you have encounter issues with the repacker not finding the files to repack, create a folder called "asset_dump" put your assets in the folder (don't put the script in the "asset_dump" folder though). 

-> If unsure which repacker to use, check the magic bytes a HEX editor or a Notepad.
